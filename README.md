# Why does this repository exist?
Quite frankly the code here is pretty bad. It's inscrutable and exists in one file which is entirely too large. So you may be wondering: "why on earth would this repository exist, let alone be public?"
The answer is actually pretty simple though. This project was the first thing I ever made using javascript, and despite how janky and poorly made it is, I would like to have it preserved for posterity.

The sketch.js file and the sprites are the only parts that existed originally, as until now the poject lived exclusively in the p5 web editor.

Project originally created in November 2021.
